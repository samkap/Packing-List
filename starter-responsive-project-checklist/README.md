# Responsive Web Design checklist for beginners

Responsive web design can be intimidating with how many elements have go into each project. I wanted to create a better checklist of what I think student or beginner responsive web designers would need to have on a checklist to help them stay on track.

For now, it is divided into: HTML, CSS, and JS from a technological stand-point. Please feel free to request anything else.
